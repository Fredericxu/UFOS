It functions well by testing and should locate any incident in the database precisely.

## 3. Summary
It would serve a fundamental functions to locate incident in the database, however, it my be hard to use for any new lovers of UFOS, if they are not familiar with the incident itself. For example, if they cant spell the city in full, the result would not show up.
### The suggestion would be: 
1. A drop down list could be created for those data in states/country/shape.
2. Summerized information (like hotmap) at the top of the webpage showing the incidents spreads.
