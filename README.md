It functions well by testing and should locate any incident in the database precisely.

## 3. Summary
It would serve a fundamental functions to locate incident in the database, however, it my be hard to use for any new lovers of UFOS, if they are not familiar with the incident itself. 
### The suggestion would be: 
1. A drop down list could be created for those data in states/country/shape.
2. Summerized information (like hotmap) at the top of the webpage showing the incidents spreads.
